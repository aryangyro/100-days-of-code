This project is a console-based coffee machine built using Python.
The program allows users to choose between espresso, latte, or cappuccino, checks if enough ingredients are available, processes coin input, calculates change, and updates remaining resources after each order.

The project helped me practice working with dictionaries, conditional logic, loops, and basic calculations while simulating how a real coffee machine works.
