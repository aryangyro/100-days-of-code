### Day 16 – Object-Oriented Coffee Machine ☕

Built a console-based coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

This project focuses on:
- Understanding classes vs objects
- Interacting between multiple classes (`Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`)
- Handling user input safely
- Managing program flow and state
- Debugging real runtime errors (NoneType handling)

This was my first proper exposure to thinking in terms of **systems** rather than single scripts.
