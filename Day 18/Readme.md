Built a Python Turtle program that creates a structured dot grid by controlling X–Y coordinates manually, avoiding floating-point comparison issues. Implemented nested loops for row-by-row rendering, randomized RGB colors for each dot, optimized drawing speed, and ensured clean visuals by disabling pen drawing. This project reinforced coordinate systems, loop control, and Turtle graphics optimization.
