# Day 12 – Guessing Game & Prime Number Function

This folder contains what I built on **Day 12** of my 100 Days of Code (Python) challenge.

Today was mostly about practicing logic, loops, and functions by building small but complete programs.

## What I Built

### Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game where the computer picks a random number and the user tries to guess it.

The game:
- Lets the user choose a difficulty
- Gives limited chances based on difficulty
- Tells the user whether to guess higher or lower
- Ends when the number is guessed or chances run out

This helped me understand how game flow works using loops and conditions.

### Prime Number Function
A small function that checks whether a given number is a prime number.

This was good practice for:
- Writing functions
- Using loops for checking conditions
- Thinking logically instead of just writing code

## What I Learned Today
- How to control program flow using `while` loops
- Why input types matter in Python
- How to break a problem into smaller steps
- Debugging mistakes by reading errors properly

---

## How to Run the Programs
```bash
python guessing_game.py
