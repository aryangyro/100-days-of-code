## Quiz Game (Python)

This project is a command-line quiz game developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The application dynamically loads questions from a data source, converts them into objects, and manages the quiz flow through a controller class. It handles user input validation, compares answers in a case-insensitive manner, tracks the user's score, and allows the quiz to terminate cleanly based on user responses.

### Key Features
- Object-Oriented design (Question & QuizBrain classes)
- Dynamic question loading
- User input normalization and validation
- Score tracking after each question
- Graceful program exit using return-based flow control

### Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects
- Loops and conditionals
- Function return values for flow control
- String handling and input sanitization

This project was built to strengthen foundational Python and OOP concepts through a practical, interactive application.
