Developed a multi-turtle racing simulation using Python’s Turtle graphics, where turtles move concurrently through event-driven animation (ontimer). Implemented a user betting system to predict the winning turtle based on color, a dynamically rendered finish line, randomized movement for unpredictability, and win/loss evaluation logic. This project reinforced concepts of event loops, animation without blocking, object management via lists, and interactive user input handling.
