# 100 Days of Code – Python

This repository documents my progress through the **100 Days of Code (Python)** challenge.

I am building small projects every day to improve my problem-solving skills, write cleaner code, and get more comfortable with Python fundamentals.

Each folder represents one day of the challenge and contains:
- The project code
- A short README explaining what I built
- Key concepts I practiced that day

## Progress So Far
- Day 11 – Blackjack game (console-based)

I’ll continue adding projects as I move forward in the challenge.
