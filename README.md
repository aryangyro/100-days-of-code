# 100 Days of Code – Python

This repository tracks my progress through the **100 Days of Code (Python)** challenge.

The goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in Python by coding every day and creating small, practical projects instead of just watching tutorials.

Each folder represents one day of learning and contains:
- The code written that day
- A short README explaining what I built
- Key concepts I practiced

## Why I’m Doing This
I’m using this challenge to:
- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Get comfortable writing Python without relying on examples
- Build a public record of consistent learning
- Prepare myself for more advanced projects in the future

## Progress
- Day 11 – Blackjack game
- Day 12 – Guessing game and prime number function

I’ll keep updating this repository as I continue the challenge.
