# Day 14 – Higher or Lower Game

This is my **Day 14 project** from the *100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp*.

The game is a terminal-based **Higher or Lower** game where the player has to guess which of two people or brands has more followers. The game continues as long as the guesses are correct.

## About the Project

In every round, two random accounts are picked from the dataset.  
Each account comes with a name, description, country, and follower count.

The player guesses:
- **A** if they think A has more followers
- **B** if they think B has more followers

If the guess is correct, the score increases.  
If it’s wrong, the game ends.
